# Plant and Raw Material Identification Website

## Overview

Myrtle is a cutting-edge online platform developed by team QuantumFrost for SIH to assist users in the accurate identification of various medicinal plants and raw materials. This innovative project leverages image processing and machine learning algorithms to provide insightful information about these botanical resources. With a rich heritage of floral diversity, India is renowned for its medicinal plant wealth, yet the identification of these valuable resources remains a significant challenge in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics.

## Problem Statement

India's diverse landscape, seasonal variations, and similar characteristics among different plant species have led to confusion and misidentification of medicinal plants and raw materials in the market. This misidentification extends to collectors, traders, and consumers alike, impacting the quality and efficacy of herbal products. The project addresses this pressing issue by developing a sophisticated software solution capable of accurately identifying these resources.
